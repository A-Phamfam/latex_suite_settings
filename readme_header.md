# Personal Latex Suite Shortcuts

[snippets.txt](./snippets.txt) is a collection of Latex snippets that I use with the [Obsidian Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite) extension. I have created these snippets to make it easier to write Latex in Obsidian. I have also included some snippets that are not part of the Latex Suite extension, but are useful for writing vector calculus and certain electromagnetics equations.

## Installation

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download).
2. Install the Latex Suite plugin by going to `Settings > Community plugins > Browse` and searching for "Latex Suite". Alternatively, you can click [here](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=latex%20suite#).
3. In settings, go to `Latex Suite` and in the `Snippets` section. Copy and paste the contents of [snippets.txt](./snippets.txt) into the text box. Alternatively, you can download the [snippets.txt](./snippets.txt) file, place it in your Obsidian vault, enable "Load snippets from file or folder" and select the file.

## Usage
Refer to the [Obsidian Latex Suite documentation](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite) for more information on how to use the extension. The cheatsheet of my personal snippets are shown below.
